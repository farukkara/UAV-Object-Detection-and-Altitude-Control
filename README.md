This code uses the absdiff function to calculate the difference between the current frame and the previous frame. The difference is then thresholded to remove any small changes and detect only significant changes (moving objects). Then it uses the findContours function to find the contours of the moving objects and check their area. If the area is greater than 1000 pixels, the code prints an alert message "Moving object detected!".

Please note that the code above is just an example and you'll need to adjust it to suit your specific use case.You may need to experiment with different threshold values and contour area values to get the best results for your particular application.
